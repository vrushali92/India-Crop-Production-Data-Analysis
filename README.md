# India-Crop-Production-Data-Analysis

India is an agricultural country and approximately 60% of the population work in this industry directly or indirectly. And this industry contributes about 18% of total GDP.

# Motivation

India has population of nearly 1.5 billion. And this thought intrigued me if India is able to produce to feed its population. 
Rainfall plays an important role in crop production. Hence I have also included rainfall data as well.

# Dataset
